<h4><strong>For Students</strong><br>Student Learning Space</h4>
<p>HOW SINGAPORE STUDENT LEARNING SPACE SUPPORTS LEARNING</p>
<p>As part of Ministry of Education’s (MOE) commitment to nurture future-ready
learners, an online learning platform known as the Singapore Student Learning
Space (SLS) is made available to the students.</p>
<p>The SLS is an online platform with tools and curriculum-aligned resources
for all students to learn at their own pace and collaboratively. With the
SLS, students can take greater ownership of their learning and pick up
skills and habits that prepare them for lifelong learning. Teachers will
also use the SLS to complement classroom teaching and learning.</p>
<p>ACCESS TO SLS</p>
<p>The SLS can be accessed from <a href="https://learning.moe.edu.sg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://learning.moe.edu.sg</a>.</p>
<p>You can refer to the following annexes:</p>
<p>a) Annex A – instructions for you to assist your child with his/her initial
login, and</p>
