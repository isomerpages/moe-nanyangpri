The VIA programme also forms part of the Life Skill programme and Well-being programme that aim to look into enhancing student well-being in NYPS.</p>

		<p><strong>MOE SEXUALITY EDUCATION IN SCHOOLS</strong></p>
		<ol>
			<li>Sexuality Education (SEd) in schools is about enabling students to understand the physiological, social and emotional changes they experience as they mature, develop healthy and rewarding relationships including those with members of the opposite sex, and make wise, informed and responsible decisions on sexuality matters. SEd is premised on the importance of the family as the basic unit of society. This means encouraging healthy, heterosexual marriages and stable nuclear family units with extended family support. The teaching and learning of SEd is based on respect for the values and beliefs of the different ethnic and religious communities in Singapore on sexuality issues.<br /><br /></li>
			<li>The goals of Sexuality Education are:</li>
			<ol>
				<ol type="i">
					<li>To help students make wise, responsible and informed decisions through the provision of accurate, current and age-appropriate <u>knowledge</u> on human sexuality and the consequences of sexual activity;</li>
					<li>To help students know themselves and build healthy and rewarding relationships through the acquisition of <u>social and emotional skills</u> of self-awareness, management of their thoughts, feelings and behaviours, development of empathy for others, possession of effective communication, problem-solving and decision-making skills; and</li>
					<li>To help students develop a moral compass, respect for themselves and for others as sexual beings, premised on the family as the basic unit of society, through the inculcation of <u>positive mainstream values and attitudes</u> about sexuality.</li>
				</ol>
			</ol>
			<li>The key messages of Sexuality Education are:</li>
			<ol>
				<ol type="i">
					<li>Love and respect yourself as you love and respect others;</li>
					<li>Build positive relationships based on love and respect (which are the foundation for strong families);</li>
					<li>Make responsible decisions for yourself, your family and society; and</li>
					<li>Abstinence before marriage is the best protection against STIs/HIV and unintended pregnancies. Casual sex can harm and hurt you and your loved ones.</li>
				</ol>

		<p><strong>OVERVIEW OF NANYANG PRIMARY SCHOOL SEXUALITY EDUCATION PROGRAMME</strong></p>
		<p>4. Sexuality Education is delivered in a holistic manner through the school curriculum. The content for Sexuality Education is grouped into five main themes: Human Development, Interpersonal Relationships, Sexual Health, Sexual Behaviour, and, Culture, Society and Law. You may click here (https://go.gov.sg/moe-sexuality-education-scope) for more information on the scope of Sexuality Education in the school curriculum.

		<p>5. The subjects that incorporate topics on sexuality include:
		<ol>a. Science <br>b. Character and Citizenship Education (CCE)<br></ol></p>
		<p><strong>SEXUALITY EDUCATION LESSONS:</strong><p>
	 	<p>6. The upper primary years mark the onset of puberty. With better nutrition and improved health care, children are reaching puberty at a younger age and have to grapple with physical, emotional and psychological changes in themselves. The implication is that our children are becoming biologically ready for sexual activity sooner without necessarily having the corresponding cognitive or emotional maturity to modulate their behaviours. Furthermore, our young are also exposed to a wide range of influences that could endanger health and undermine the integrity of the family. Our students require guidance so that they can respond with discernment to the sexual messages in the media and other sources.</p>
		<p>7. Sexuality Education (SEd) lessons are taught as part of CCE (FTGP) at Primary 5 and 6. In SEd, students learn to understand the physiological, social and emotional changes they experience as they mature, develop healthy and rewarding relationships including those with members of the opposite sex, and make wise, informed and responsible decisions on sexuality matters. </p>
		<p><strong>At Nanyang Primary School, the following Sexuality Education lessons will be taught in 2023:</strong></p>

			<p><strong>NATIONAL EDUCATION (NE)<br /></strong><br /><strong>Commemorating of 4 NE events</strong><br /><strong><br />1. Total Defence Day (TDD)</strong><br />TDD is commemorated in February (Term 1) every year to remind us that we must defend Singapore ourselves. On this day, NYPS students will reflect on the contributions of the various groups of unsung heroes in Singapore. In tandem with the Gratitude Programme, our students write thank you notes on the NYPS Gratitude cards to these heroes. The school will then help our students send these cards to them.<br /><br /><strong>2. International Friendship Day (IFD)<br /></strong>This day is dedicated to the understanding of Singapore&rsquo;s relations with its neighbouring countries and beyond. It aims to nurture in our students the spirit of friendship and partnership among different countries and people and to appreciate diverse cultures, different perspectives and ideas. On this day, our students will also write thank you notes on the NYPS Gratitude cards to their friends to show appreciation of their friendship.<br /><br /><strong>3. Racial Harmony Day (RHD)</strong><br />Students are reminded of the importance of maintaining racial and religious harmony in the country on this day. Our students learn the importance of making choices that promote and advocate inter-cultural understanding, which build strong relationships between people of all races, cultures and nationalities, and strengthen our distinctive identity as Singaporeans living in multicultural Singapore.<br /><br /><strong>4. National Day</strong><br />The National Day celebration provides a good opportunity for our students to reflect on how far Singapore has come since our independence in 1965 and understand that none of this would have been possible without sheer grit and determination, a forward- looking government and unity among Singaporeans.<br /><br /><strong>P5 NE Show</strong><br />Since 1997, the National Education (NE) Show has been organised to instil a sense of patriotism in students and to bring across the significance of our National Day. Every year, the Primary 5 students will have to privilege to participate in this event which aims to inculcate NE values in our students.<br /><br /><strong>FIELD-BASED LEARNING EXPERIENCES ACROSS LEVELS</strong><br />Field-based learning experiences (FbL) extend beyond the walls of the classroom as students are exposed to learning in real-world settings.<br /><br />Click&nbsp;<a href="/files/NYPS%20FieldBased%20Learning.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>&nbsp;to view the list of Field-based learning experiences according to the various levels and its learning focus.<br /><br /></p>
			<p><strong>CULTURAL INFUSION PROGRAMME</strong><br>Our school-based Cultural Infusion Programme aims to heighten the socio-cultural awareness and sensitivity among our students. We aim to enable our students to be active citizens where they can appreciate, connect and relate to friends of other races and culture. Young as they are, we want to prepare them to embrace diversity while staying socially cohesive. A lesson package for each level was designed and carried out during SS periods.<br /><br /><strong>NE CONTEMPORARY ISSUES</strong><br />NE is anchored on citizenship dispositions to guide our students in exploring and examining their Singapore identity, and in helping them realise that all Singaporeans have an important role to play for the country to thrive. To nurture the qualities of&nbsp;<strong>a sense of belonging, a sense of reality and a sense of hope</strong>&nbsp;in our students, NE will be driven by three thrusts in order to provide students with rich, authentic and relevant learning experiences. The three thrusts are</p>
			<ul> 
				<ul>
					<li>A shared and lively Singapore narrative will be generated</li>
					<li>Citizenship experiences will be created and enhanced for all students</li>
					<li>A professional community engaged in pedagogical innovation</li>
				</ul>
			</ul>
			<p><br /><strong>SOCIAL STUDIES (SS)</strong><br /><strong>Inquiry Approach to Learning Social Studies</strong><br />The SS syllabus is designed in three broad clusters entitled Discovering Self and Immediate Environment (P1 &amp; P2), Understanding Singapore in the Past and Present (P3 &amp; P4) and Appreciating the World and Region We Live In (P5 &amp; P6).</p>
