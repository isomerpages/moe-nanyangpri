为了让学生学会有效沟通，联系世界，我校对外合作发展部通过有针对性的计划以及与当地社区合作伙伴和海外结对学校的合作来增强和丰富学生的学习。

我们为学生营造各种机会与来自中国，香港，印度，日本和韩国的师生进行互动，让他们学习，了解其他文化。

通过拜访我们的海外配对学校，我们的学生有机会体验其他国家的学习和生活。


Aligned with the school's key shift from “Communicator to Connector", the Strategic Department aims to:

* Enhance and enrich students’ learning through targeted programmes and collaboration with local community partners and overseas twinning schools;
* Create opportunities for students to learn and connect with communities of different cultures. Such interactions enrich and inspire teachers and students;
* Provide students with the platform to cultivate their social awareness and soft skills; and
* Harness the Outward, Maker and Growth (OMG) mindset among students. Through authentic context and culturally-relevant experience, every immersion programme will include a Maker activity that is geared towards creativity and problem solving.
