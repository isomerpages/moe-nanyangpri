**亨利·马蒂斯曾经说过：“创新需要勇气。"**  
        我们相信每个孩子都有想象力及强烈的创造欲望。美育部门希望通过丰富多彩的表演与视觉艺术课程，把学生培养成热爱艺术、富有创意并充满自信的终生学习者。  
  
        我们鼓励学生勇于探索和体验各种不同的艺术形式，大胆地表达自己，并与社会和文化建立有意义的联系。在他们六年的小学教育中，学生将有机会接触美术、音乐、舞蹈和演艺等课程。他们也有机会参观美术馆和艺术中心，并且参与校内的各种演出，如音乐会和音乐剧。美育部致力于发扬丰富多彩的艺术文化，让学生有机会展现各自的创意，并激发他们对各种艺术的兴趣。

**“Creativity Takes Courage”- Henri Matisse**

We believe every child has the innate desire to imagine and create. The Aesthetics Department is committed to nurturing students into creative and confident life-long learners who enjoy and appreciate the arts through a vibrant Performing and Visual Arts curriculum.

Students are encouraged to explore and experience different creative art forms, express themselves confidently and make meaningful connections with culture and society. Throughout their six years in Nanyang, students will engage in various art, music, dance and drama programmes and masterclasses, learning journeys to museums and arts venues, as well as different school performances like concerts and musicals. The Department strives to develop a vibrant arts culture that celebrates every child’s creative expression and provides every student with the opportunity to develop and thrive in the learning and appreciation of various forms of the arts.
