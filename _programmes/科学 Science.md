**部门目标**  
本校科学部旨在教育学生科学知识及技能，激发学生的探究精神，并培育学生终身学习意愿。  
  
**科学部门学习活动：**  
  
**探究式学习**  
学生通过动手做、做中学，主动进行调查、操作与探索活动，获得科学知识，培养能力，同时发展学习态度与道德价值观。  
老师使用5E学习环（参与、探究、理解、扩展、评价）来进行深入教学。  
  
**玩具@学习**  
利用玩具学习科学知识是南小特有的一项学习活动。科学老师每年都会为各个年级量身定做，设计适当的活动与课程。学生在这些活动中，将会享受到动手做，做中学的乐趣。同时，学生还将有机会把所学的科学知识运用到设计及创造自己的玩具中去，以激发他们的创新能力。  
  
**科学新星**  
“科学新星”是一项趣味性十足的活动。学生们学以致用，将平时所学的科学知识运用到相关的实验中去。老师会根据学生的现场表现来进行评分。但这项评估结果不会包括在期中或期末考试成绩里。这项活动旨在让学生享受学习的乐趣，而不是过分强调成绩！  
  
**户外学习体验**  
户外学习体验能给学生们提供不同的学习环境，这不仅能促进学生自我学习的动力，而且能让学生学到不同的知识点。  
学校还提供了户外学习之旅，以让学生能够近距离观察自然界里的生物习性。  
  
**自主学习**  
在2017年，科学部在教学中全面推广“谷歌课堂”这个平台来辅助教学。谷歌课堂的使用使老师们可以将相应的知识进行讲解、录音并上传到网上，同时也提升了学生自主学习的自由度。这一平台的使用也为今年推广“新加坡学生学习平台” （SLS）做了铺垫，从而让学生更容易上手使用。  
  

**Goal**     
To develop lifelong learners with inquisitive minds through the acquisition of scientific knowledge and skills.

  

**Programmes**    
The Science Programme consists of:

**Inquiry-based Learning**    
To enable students to acquire knowledge and understanding of their work based on investigations, application of skills and processes of inquiry, while also developing attitudes and values that are essential to the practice of Science. Teachers use the 5E (Engage, Explore, Explain, Elaborate & Evaluate) method in conducting Science lessons in class.

**Toys @ Work**    
A unique programme in Nanyang for the teaching and learning of Science through the use of toys. There are designated Toys@Work activities to be completed for each level in a year. These lessons enable the students to have hands-on experience in deriving Scientific concepts to be covered in the syllabus by playing with toys. They also get the opportunity to design and create their own toys to demonstrate the same concept learnt, hence allowing them to also display their creativity.

**Science Nova**   
Students have fun while their practical skills are being assessed and their performance for this alternative assessment does not contribute to their overall SA1 or SA2 scores. Less emphasis on test scores helps to enhance the joy of learning!

**Outdoor Experiential Learning**    
Authentic learning environments are provided for students to engage in self-directed learning while learning specific concepts taught in their respective levels.

The school also conducts outdoor learning trails for students to enable them to observe living organisms in their natural habitats and to observe their interactions with the environment.

**Self-directed Learning**   
In 2017, we fully embarked on the use of Google Classroom in order to leverage ICT platforms to enhance teaching and learning for the students. It promotes self-directed learning and allows students to revisit concepts at any time they need to, with the teachers’ audio explanation. This avenue for learning has since been further enhanced to include aspects of monitoring of understanding via the SLS platform to further benefit the students.
