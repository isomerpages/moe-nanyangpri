<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 南小弦乐团成立于1993年。从只有几个小提琴手的小乐团开始，逐渐加入了中提琴、 大提琴和低音提琴，最终形成了现在的规模。从2000年开始，一直到2016年，在指挥陈芝弥女士的带领下，我们在新加坡青年节中央评审（2013年后称为新加坡青年节艺术展演汇）中屡屡获得最高荣誉。2018年，指挥卓铭远先生执棒我校弦乐团，在新加坡青年节艺术展演汇 中再次获得了优异奖 。2013年 ， 我校弦乐团远赴捷克的布拉格参加了 &ldquo;Young2013Prague&rdquo;，与来自不同国家、不同文化的音乐家交流，获益匪浅。</p>
<p>Established in 1993, the NYPS String Ensemble has expanded from a small group of violinists to an ensemble that includes the viola, cello and double-bass. Under the guidance of our teachers and coaches, the String Ensemble has consistently attained the highest honour at the SYF. We also received a grading of&nbsp;<em>Outstanding</em>&nbsp;in the Western Australia Orchestra Festival in 2010. A group well-seasoned to public performance, we travelled to Prague in March in 2013 to take part in the&nbsp;<strong><em>Young 2013 Prague,&nbsp;</em></strong>where we met and interacted with performing choirs, orchestras and ensembles of different nationalities and cultures. Our two public performances were very well-received and we have received invitations to take part in other festivals in America.</p>
