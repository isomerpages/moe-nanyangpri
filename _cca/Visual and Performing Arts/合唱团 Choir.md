<p>The Nanyang Primary School Choir was set up in 1989. Since then, the Choir has participated in numerous performances and competitions with stellar results and is always warmly received.</p>
<p>Together with our dedicated teachers and experienced conductor, the CCA provides training in vocal techniques and voice production for any child who has an interest in singing. Not only that, choir members enjoy contributing to a part of something bigger and forging strong bonds with their fellow schoolmates through a myriad of concerts and exciting performances.</p>
