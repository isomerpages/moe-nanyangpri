<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 羽毛球这项课外活动分为校队与兴趣小组两个部分。除了让学生在活动中培养兴趣，尽兴地玩乐外，他们也会学习羽毛球的基本功与规则，培养团队合作、彼此尊重、坚持到底等体育精神。</p>
<p>The Nanyang Badminton CCA comprises competitive and non-competitive groups of children who hone their skills and develop camaraderie every week. Besides the elements of interest, fun and enjoyment, basic fundamental skills and rules of the game are imparted during our CCA sessions. Training sessions include basic agility exercises, footwork, lob, drop, smash, push and drive as the children learn the rules of the games for doubles and singles. Values such as discipline, commitment, respect, perseverance, team spirit and fair play are regularly instilled in our players as they train, play and share their experiences with one another.</p>
