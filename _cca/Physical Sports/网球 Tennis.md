<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;参加网球队的学生将在快乐的氛围中培养对网球的热忱以及体育精神。在教练的磨练下，学生将培养起不屈不饶的毅力以及坚定的自信心，同时真正成为球队的一份子。球技突出、品格端正的球员可期待成为代表南洋小学的校队队员，参加一年一度的校际赛事。</p>
<p>In the Tennis CCA, we hope to cultivate a sense of fun and passion for tennis, focusing on sportsmanship, integrity and teamwork during training sessions and competitions. Through their diligence and passion for the sport, children can build up their resilience and confidence to be better players and teammates.</p>
<p>Children who exhibit potential in the game and possess good character can look forward to representing the school in the annual inter-school competitions.</p>
