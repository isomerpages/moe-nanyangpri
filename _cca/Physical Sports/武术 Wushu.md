南小武术队自2005年成立至今，已经培养了1200多名学生。除了武术基本功，我们也培养学生对中国文化的欣赏能力。我们的队员不仅学习武术的基本动作，而且还将这些基本动作转化为专业协调的武术表演，包括长拳、南拳、太极拳以及各种武器，如剑、刀、枪和棍等。

        武术队为队员提供机会，让他们在自律、自信、适应力和团队合作等方面全面发展。

        有抱负并肯付出努力的队员会受邀加入校队，挑战自己，以发挥他们的潜力。此外，校队积极参与校内外各大表演，为创造南小的华族文化氛围做出贡献。  

Formed in 2005, the Wushu CCA has developed basic strength, flexibility and an appreciation of the Chinese culture in more than 1200 students. Our students not only learn the basic stances and kicks that are fundamental to wushu, but also transfer these basics into specialised well-coordinated performances involving Changquan, Nanquan, Taijiquan and various weapons such as swords, broadswords, spears and cudgels.

Our CCA provides students with the opportunity to develop their characters and seek improvement in areas such as self-discipline, confidence, resilience and teamwork. Aspiring students train hard to be invited to the school team and challenge themselves to stretch their potential in the sport. In addition, the school team is committed to contributing to the strong Chinese culture in Nanyang with regular school performances throughout the year.
