<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;更快、更高、更强一直以来都是每一位田径选手的共同目标，而在南小参加田径队不止是挑战自我的极限，同时也是充满趣味、具有教育性的。学生在老师与教练的指导下学习各类体能项目，并根据自身的特长进行个别项目的专业训练。田径队给予每个有潜质的孩子充分的机会发展特长。</p>

       田径队员每年都会受邀参与各项赛事。除了赢得荣誉以外，他们更能亲身领悟体育精神之所在。  

The Track & Field CCA provides a fun yet challenging training programme to improve students’ health, fitness, coordination and overall movement skills such as running, jumping and throwing. Children will learn an array of skills such as basic running techniques, agility and sprints during training. These are essential skills for sports that will stand them in good stead. Children who are inclined towards special events such as long jump, high jump, shot put and hurdles are provided with numerous opportunities to stretch their potential.

With a team of dedicated teachers and coaches, the children are regularly exposed to a variety of competitions throughout the year. We aim to promote participation and inculcate sportsmanship and the values of fair play, respect, excellence, teamwork and discipline among the students in the CCA.
