<p>The Football CCA equips our footballers with life skills through regular game exposure to football matches and carnivals.</p>
<p>Children who show an interest in the sport have the opportunity to pick up basic skills such as passing, dribbling, and shooting as well as understanding the rules of the game. The training programme challenges children to progress towards more demanding game techniques such as tackling, trapping and goalkeeping. At the end of each fulfilling training session, everyone will have a chance to apply the concepts learnt, in a match.</p>
<p>Children with potential and tenacity may be promoted to represent the school in inter-school competitions.</p>
