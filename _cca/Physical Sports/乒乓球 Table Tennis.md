<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 乒乓球这项课外活动的宗旨是让不同能力、不同水平的学生都能自得其乐。除了球技高超的校队球员外，我校也有好些在闲暇时间热热闹闹地围在乒乓桌前切磋球技的业余球员。在老师与教练的带领下，学生在习得球技以外，也懂得体育精神的精髓所在。努力进取的优秀队员们将获得与他校队员一较高低的机会。</p>
<p>The Table Tennis CCA aims to provide all students with the opportunity to enjoy the sport regardless of their skill level. We have a strong team of competitive players as well as a large population of children who enjoy playing the game recreationally during recess.</p>
<p>With a team of dedicated teachers and coaches, the Table Tennis CCA encourages children to embody the basic sporting values of a winning spirit, appreciation for teammates, commitment to a healthy lifestyle and ethical behaviour. Children who have the tenacity to train hard will have numerous opportunities to experience the thrill of playing against players from other schools.</p>
