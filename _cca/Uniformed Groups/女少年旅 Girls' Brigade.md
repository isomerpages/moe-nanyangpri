<br>南洋小学女少年旅第12分队秉持“Every Girl a Leader. Every Officer a Servant Leader”的信念，致力于培育具备责任感与领导力的女队员。女少年旅致力于赋能每一位队员，使她们能够发挥潜能、超越自我。在谦卑、勇气、尊荣与慷慨的核心价值观引导下，我们培养学生成为温暖亲切、乐于服务的领袖。<br>
<br>每逢星期四，队员们身着整洁的蓝色制服，整队集合。在成人志愿领袖与教师的带领下，通过有系统化的课程安排，女队员们在纪律、品格与领导力方面稳步成长。每一次集会都是一次服务与学习的机会，鼓励她们积极为家庭、学校、社会与世界作出有意义的贡献。<br>
<br>通过“女少年旅友谊之手”、“Dr Low Guat Tin Challenge”以及“Fast Food and Fuzz”露营活动等特色项目，队员们的感恩意识得到培养的同时，也让她们有机会回馈社会、关注社会议题，并学会在日常中尊重他人。

<br>“Every Girl a Leader. Every Officer a Servant Leader.” This belief guides the 12th Company in Nanyang Primary School. The Girls’ Brigade seeks to equip, empower and enable every girl to realise her fullest potential. Guided by the core values of humility, courage, honour and deep generosity, we seek to guide our girls to become a warm, approachable, serving leader - remembered for her humility and desire to leave people and places better than when she first finds them.<br>
<br>Every Thursday, the girls don their smart blue uniforms and gather as a company. Through a structured programme led by Volunteer Adult Leaders and teachers, they grow in discipline, character and leadership. The sessions nurture a heart of service as the girls learn to contribute meaningfully to their home, school, community and world.<br>
<br>Signature events such as The Girls' Brigade Friend-in-Deed initiative, Dr Low Guat Tin Challenge, and the Fast Food and Fuzz Camp deepen their sense of gratitude and purpose while offering opportunities to serve and give back to society, gain awareness of social issues, understand the impact of choices, and treat others with respect and dignity.<br>
