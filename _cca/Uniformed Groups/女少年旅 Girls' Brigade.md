<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 南洋小学第十二届女少年旅旨在充分发掘每个孩子的潜力。每个星期六的早晨，孩子们都会穿着整齐的制服，准时在南小的操场上集合，期待着参与老师精心设计的课程。女少年旅的活动着重于养成良好的纪律以及正确的价值，以激发学生成为热衷于服务家庭、学校、社区与国家的青年领袖。</p>
<p>The 12th Company in Nanyang Primary School aims to develop each girl to her fullest potential by equipping, empowering and enabling every girl. We firmly believe that &ldquo;Every Girl a Leader, Every Officer a Servant Leader.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Every Saturday, the girls don their smart blue uniform and report punctually to fall-in as a company at 8.00 a.m. Through the CCA, which focuses on discipline, values and drill, the girls develop character, leadership and responsibility. They learn to be of service to the home, school, community and nation by exploring different activities and gaining knowledge in the different aspects of life during the sessions conducted by the Volunteer Adult Leaders and teachers. Events such as Girls' Brigade Friendship Day, Fast-Food &amp; Fuzz Camp also allow the girls to serve the community, to appreciate the things that they have and to give back to society every year.</p>
<p>Overall, the Girls&rsquo; Brigade provides a range of projects and activities to engage girls in activities that reflect friendship, discipline and fun.</p>
