<p>“Sure and Steadfast”是南洋小学男少年旅的座右铭。</p>
<p>在南洋小学，42J分队在一群充满热忱的成人志愿领袖（Volunteer Adult Leaders）的支持下，致力于培育具有高尚品格的学生。42J队通过系统化的培训与多样化的活动，引导学生成长为忠诚、负责任的公民，同时帮助他们发掘个人的领导潜能。

分队队员每逢星期四身穿整洁的蓝色制服集结，开展每周例常活动。活动内容涵盖步操训练、诗歌敬拜、灵修及团队游戏，旨在建立学生的身份认同感与团队凝聚力。通过共同学习与互动，学生不仅建立了深厚的友谊，也逐步培养起服务他人、关爱社会的精神。

男少年旅注重制服、徽章与纪律，在严谨的组织框架下，致力于培养学生的自尊、自律、团队合作能力及坚毅精神，为他们日后成为具备领导素养的青年领袖奠定坚实基础。</p><p>
</p><p>Sure and Steadfast is the Boys’ Brigade motto.</p>
<p>The 42J Company in Nanyang Primary School, with the help of our passionate Volunteer Adult Leaders, aims to develop boys with moral character, training them to grow up into loyal and responsible citizens who will develop their leadership potential through various outdoor activities.</p>
<p>Every Saturday, the boys don their smart blue uniform and fall-in punctually as the Lead Boys start the parade at 8.00 a.m. The Boys’ Brigade instills a sense of common identity and&nbsp;<em>esprit de corps&nbsp;</em>through weekly participation in drills, competition and games. As the boys learn, play and develop a spirit of service to others, they form a sense of identity and belonging to one another and to the school.</p>
<p>Through a focus on the structure of uniform, badges and drill every Saturday, the boys develop the habits of discipline, self-respect, grooming and teamwork which will shape them into future leaders of the country.</p>
