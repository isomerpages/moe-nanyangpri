<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;童军致力于为南小培养秉承童军理念与纲领的优秀成员。自我塑成活动分为室内与户外两种，融入了乐趣以及激发积极性的元素。这类循序渐进的活动让童军们挑战自我、克服困难、培养生活技能以及大我精神。</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;童军可根据兴趣完成指定任务以此换取多达50项的各类技能勋章及奖项。与此同时，这也培养了效忠精神、正确的国民价值观并提高了品德修养。</p>
<p>Aligned to the vision and mission of SSA (Singapore Scout Association), the Pegasus Cub Scout unit aims to provide a conducive group environment which helps the cubs learn and apply the Scout Promise and the Scout Law.</p>
<p>The self-developmental activities planned, both in- and outdoors, are based on the natural sense of fun and enthusiasm of the children. These intellectually stimulating activities are progressive and challenge a child to face and overcome obstacles. They help to develop essential life skills which will aid the children when contributing to the greater good.</p>
<p>Cubs are presented with the opportunity to work on and obtain up to 50 different proficiency badges which cater to the different interests and skills of each cub.</p>
<p>As they develop in their proficiency and commitment to the CCA, the cubs are tested on Citizenship, Leadership and Responsibility, Physical Skills, Self-Reliance, Adventure and Fun. They gradually work towards the Bronze, Silver, Gold Arrow and finally, the Akela Award, the highest award that a cub can attain at Primary 6.</p>
