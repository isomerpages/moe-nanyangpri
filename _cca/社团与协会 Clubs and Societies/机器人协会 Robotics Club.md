<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 机器人协会是由一群有兴趣学习和使用机器人的学生组成的。机器人协会通过构建和编程，让会员有机会发展他们的创造力、批判性思维和解决问题的能力。会员将在四年级完成基础机器人课程，然后再进入五、六年级的高级机器人课程。</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 要创建一个竞赛类机器人，学生必须使用一些STEM（科学、科技、工程、数学科际整合）技能。创造力和解决问题的能力对于构建可以完成任务的机器人更是至关重要。当机器人没有按预期运行时，学生就必须提出创造性的解决方案。</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 机器人协会会员也能够参与各种校际和国家级别的比赛。在此过程中，他们不仅需要独立工作也必须学会团队合作。多年来，机器人协会不断发展，在经验丰富的导师和敬业的教师的帮助下，为会员提供了更多发挥自己潜能和创新能力的平台。</p>
<p>The Robotics Club is a gathering of students who are interested in learning about and working with robots. The Robotics Club gives students the opportunity to develop their creativity, critical thinking, and problem solving skills. This is achieved through technology to build and programme robots to perform tasks and tackle problems. The students will complete a basic Robotics course in Primary 4, before moving on to Advanced Robotics from Primary 5 to Primary 6.</p>
<p>To create a competition-ready robot, students will have to use a number of soft and hard STEM skills. Creativity and problem-solving are essential in building robots that can complete obstacles. Students will have to think outside the box and come up with creative solutions when the robot does not perform as expected.</p>
<p>The Robotic Club members are also exposed to various inter-school and national level competitions, to give them a platform to showcase their skills and apply what they have learnt. In the process, they also learn to work independently as well as cooperate with their team members. The club has evolved over the years to provide members with opportunities to acquire higher levels of robotics skills and achievements with help from our experienced coaches and committed teachers.</p>
<p>Through these experiences, students will acquire values such as teamwork and strive towards excellence.</p>
