<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 一枚硬币总有两面，看问题往往也有多种观点。因此，我们可以通过各种观点针对问题进行分析，并研究它们可能带来的影响。在南小辩论队，我们鼓励队员衡量轻重，以便做出明智的决定。我们的目标是培养队员的批判性思维和演讲技巧，让他们能够保持开放的心态，清晰地思考并不惧压力，自信地表达自己的想法。辩论队还教授队员宝贵的生活技能，让他们学会团队协作，分析复杂的论点。</p>
<p>There are always two sides to the same coin and issues often have more than one perspective through which we can analyse them and study their effects on different groups of people. In the Debate Club, we encourage our members to explore the costs and gains before making an informed decision. We aim to develop a culture of critical thinking and discourse so that our members can keep an open mind, think clearly and articulate their thoughts confidently under pressure. The club also imparts valuable life skills so that our members are able to work collaboratively as a team to analyse complex arguments.</p>
